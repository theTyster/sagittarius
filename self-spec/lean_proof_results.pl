% Schema: plugins/shifting/references/pipeline-schema/lean-proof-results.md
% Consumed by instantiate-properties (Stage 5), realize-specification (Stage 6),
% and the explain closer — as a STRUCTURED KB, not prose.
%
% MACHINE-CHECK STATUS (real elaboration, not asserted):
%   `cd thoughts/lean && LAKE_ARTIFACT_CACHE=true lake build` => exit 0, 0 errors,
%   0 warnings, 0 live `sorry`. `#print axioms` on all 22 theorems =>
%   "does not depend on any axioms" for every one (no sorryAx, no Classical).
%   These are constructive kernel-checked proofs across all 7 invariants.
%
% I-3 RE-STATEMENT (2026-05-29, adjacent loopback after the disprove gate):
%   The disprove gate REFUTED the original i3_termination as VACUOUS (a constant
%   measure + identity step inhabited it). I-3 was re-stated in place over a
%   CONCRETE step relation that strictly decreases the lex measure; the verdict
%   stays `proven` but the degenerate witness now fails to type-check. See
%   restatement_note(p_v1_i3, ...) and the rewritten proof_strategy(p_v1_i3, ...).
%   The obsolete Proofs/I3Vacuity.lean (which attacked the old form) was removed
%   from the build; its regression intent is folded into I3Termination.lean as
%   i3_identity_step_is_rejected + i3_no_measure_preserving_step.
%
% PROVENANCE DISCIPLINE (enforcement rule cwa_negation_neq_lean_proof):
%   every theorem carries a provenance_annotation/3 whose value is READ OFF the
%   corresponding fact's negation_provenance/2 in target-world.pl. The 2
%   CWA-absent premises (workflow_artifact_exists_on_disk,
%   self_verification_run_completed) are NOT formal properties and are NOT
%   treated as Lean-disproved — recorded as cwa_check(_, _, verified) +
%   lean_skipped(_, cwa_absence_verified_directly). absent =/= disproved.
%
% D-10 VALIDATION: each theorem bounded by `set_option maxHeartbeats 400000`
%   (deterministic work-units, not wall-clock). No theorem exhausted budget;
%   no `unprovable` verdict. The only infra wall-clock was a `timeout` backstop
%   on `lake build`, never a control signal. Mathlib was never rebuilt (oleans
%   cached). This run dogfoods D-10's heartbeat-bounded determinism for real.
