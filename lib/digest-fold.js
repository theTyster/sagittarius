// foldDigest folds the specialists' AGENT-EMITTED routing recommendations
// (advance | gap | halt, plus gap/verdict fields) into the single routable STAGE
// DIGEST the proven loop branches on. It is PURE + DETERMINISTIC: no agent, no
// artifact-content inspection. It REPLACES the former assembler-AGENT — an extra
// LLM projection layer between the judges and the digest (the lossy-projection
// failure mode) — so folding in code keeps verdict authority with the specialists.
//
// C-2 BOUNDARY (locked by tests/digest_fold.c2_regression_guard.test.js — the
// pre-kimmy C-2 re-attack found two real violations in an earlier foldDigest):
//   - gapClass comes ONLY from the agent-emitted failureClass, else a fixed
//     CONSTANT — it is NEVER synthesized from substrate identity (__agentType /
//     stage). gapClass keys withinLoopLimit (a CONTROL decision); deriving it from
//     identity would make WHERE the run halts depend on which specialist the
//     substrate routed to rather than on agent judgement. (Violation A, fixed.)
//   - coreObligation=true is a hard-stop AXIS: it FORCES halt even on a gap-routed
//     result; it must never be demoted to a recoverable loopback. (Violation B.)
//   - the verdict word is carried verbatim or null; the substrate never derives it.
//
// MIRROR: realized/sagittarius.realized.mjs inlines this function VERBATIM
// (the Workflow-tool host has no require); the two function bodies must stay
// byte-identical — only the module wiring (require vs inline) differs.

 * Fold the specialists' agent-emitted ROUTING recommendations into the routable
 * STAGE DIGEST. PURE + DETERMINISTIC — no agent, no artifact-content inspection.
 * Each specialist already emitted its own routing (advance|gap|halt) + gap/verdict
 * fields (it is the judge, in its own window); this merely MERGES them into the
 * shape the proven loop routes on (C-2: the substrate honors agent-emitted fields,
 * it never derives a verdict). This REPLACES the former assembler-AGENT, which was
 * an extra LLM projection layer between the judges and the digest (the lossy-
 * projection failure mode) — folding in code keeps verdict authority with the
 * specialists and removes a per-stage agent call.
 *
 * @param {string} stage    the stage producing this digest
 * @param {object} brief    the stage brief (reserved for caller-signature
 *                          symmetry with the realized runStage; not read here)
 * @param {Array}  results  specialist results, each carrying agent-emitted
 *                          routing/gap/verdict fields (plus substrate __agentType
 *                          identity tags that MUST NOT influence routable fields)
